# bookBuddy
A RESTful Express.js web application to track newly released and cult classic novels of interest and store them for future reading/purchasing.

Book buddy is a personal web application that simply allows you to store and sort books and authors of interest. Simply take a snapshot of your book in the store of from the web, give it a title and voila! 

Book buddy was built using Mongodb to store authors and books. A simple RESTful server manages its tasks and allows interaction between the local database and the presentation. The templating engine .ejs was used to structure the markup and to dynamically pass data from the data documents. 

Express js has been used to inject functionality and allow universal Javascript. 
Middleware created to handle errors creating books/authors as to not have bloated functions.

some more nonsense as my contributions are no longer showing up...
